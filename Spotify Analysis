/* SPOTIFY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT */

/* For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021/)
Then I created a table and inserted the .csv Spotify data into the table (in SQLiteStudio).
Finally, I performed analytics on the data. */

/* Creating the Spotify data table: */

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

/* I then inserted the Spotify .csv data into the table (in SQLiteStudio).*/

/* Lastly, I explored & analyzed the data */

/* Who are the top 10 artists based on average popularity? Show average danceability and average energy as well. */

ORDER BY energy desc;


/* What artist released the longest song? */ 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

/* Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table using a CTE (common table expression). 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”. */
